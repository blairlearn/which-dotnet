# What version of the .Net Framework is installed?

This is a handy little [PowerShell script from Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed#query-the-registry-using-powershell) for determining which version of the .Net framework is installed.

**NOTE:** This is for the Windows-only "Classic" version 4.x framework. For the newer versions (aka "dotnet core") run `dotnet --version`.
